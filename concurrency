Why concurrency
Moories law for single CPU speed
natural concurrency in some apps   things running in parallel
political bondaries   uber app and server

concurrency architectures
A. SIMD/GPU
B. Claster/MIMD    high-speed network
C. Multi threaded    multiple threads of control, one shared memory


thread running simultaneously

problem: correctly and reliably coding in This architechture

History of multi-threading 
Initial appends:(no model)
Thread1   Memory(Tree)    Thread2
race condition:  thread thinks add worked but did not!

locks: exclusive access to data
lock, read, then release, another thread can read

Semephore, synchronized

Bad news: cyclic wait-for = deadlock

Solutions to Java/C/C++... shoud data issue
A  Ownership (Rust)    owned by #2,   owned by #1    extend ownership
B   Channels and No shareins,  (Go, clojure, Crystal,..)
    Thread1 Memory     Memory Thread2   get ->>> put
    looks a lot like  inter-process communication,   MPT claster
    still can get deadlock(waiting for put from end other)
    passing a bug coding penalty
    But , model is much simpler, fewer nasty bugs.
C The Actor Model
    e.g. Erlang, Elixir, Pony, Scala
    Actor1   Messages                                     Actor2
   Idle ->|   [1 <- 'hi(x)] (a message to actor1)           |
   Send(2,'ho(1))  [2 <- 'ho(i)]
    Actors are 
      1. Reactive
           A. default is idle
           B. gets a message
           C. does stuff(sned messages, create actors, No receive so no deadlock)
           D. become idle
    
    
      2.Actors have their own state(no shared state)
      
      3.Each actor has a unique name, a1,a2,a3
      
      4.Messaging protocol
         1.fairness: never lose messages or store messages
         2.can queue up
         3. arrival order doesn't have to be send order(UDP, not TCP)
    
      5. Actirs are object-like 
            a name is object name
            message us â€˜msg(0) data
            message are first-data expressions)            
            self-aware

AFbV - an actor language    A for actors, V for variants
Grammer
e:: = ...Fb... | n(e) | Match ... |  e(actor name) <- e(message package, e.g. 'hi(0) | Create(e,e)
v :: = a (address like cells) | ...FbV...

Rules 
    1. "normal" => rulels for a single actor, also need to heep track of side effect
            .messages
            .actor creations
         so, 
    2. Global actor soup    soup -> soup -> soup
    (f1('h1(0)) =>(a(2)<-'ho(1)) f1')
